				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>I was raised in Leesburg, central Florida. My parents and extended family come from St. Louis, MO. As a child I enjoyed playing piano, which has become a lifelong hobby. In high school I became interested in engineering, and I took some college classes in computer science. (An aside: there's actually a lot of similarities between the way people revise computer code, and the way people codify laws into statutes.) To this day I still enjoy writing small programs and using computers, whether for fun or to help with work.</p>
				<p>As a young adult I managed my father's medical practice. For eight years I managed the books, payroll, employees, IT, and regulatory compliance for the small business. I regularly dealt with medical terminology, insurance practices, employment contracts, service agreements, OSHA regulations, and more. I also helped our medical assistants navigate complicated insurance issues. In this role I often served as a sort of patient advocate.</p>
				<p>My work experiences fostered an appreciation for law. First I researched laws and regulations applicable to my job. Then, when I got home, I would sometimes read about why and how those laws were passed and how they are enforced. I love reading a well-crafted argument (and making one too), and once I delved into case law there was no turning back. My goal is to turn this pasttime into a career.</p>
