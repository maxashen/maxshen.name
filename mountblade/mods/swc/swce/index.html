		<h1>Star Wars Conquests</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the Star Wars Conquests Encyclopedia!</p>
		<p><em>Star Wars Conquests</em> (SWC for short) is a mod for TaleWorlds Entertainment's 2008 video game, <em>Mount & Blade</em>. As of July 18, 2021, the most recent version is version 0.9.4-final.</p>
		<p>From the game's license and disclaimer file,</p>
		<blockquote><p>This is a Star Wars mod for Mount & Blade 1.010/1.011. There are three factions in the game: Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, and the Hutt Cartel. Each faction includes over 12 different troops (Jedi, Sith, Stormtroopers, Commando's, Scout Troopers, Rebel Pilots, Skiff Guards, etc) and the mercenaries in the game have been switched to various aliens species like Wookiees, Gamorreans, Twileks, Rodians, Trandoshans, and others. All textures for the user interface and in towns/castles/villages have been switched and the map has been switched to a space texture with planets. The Training and Quick Battles have been modified and the Custom Battle Mod and other functionality have also been integrated. Many gameplay changes including companions don't complain.</p></blockquote>
